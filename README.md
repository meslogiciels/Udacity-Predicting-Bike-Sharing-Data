# Udacity-Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Data

In this project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program, I had to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset (that came from the UCI Machine Learning Database).

The purpose of building a neural network from the ground up was to give me a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving on to higher level tools such as PyTorch.
